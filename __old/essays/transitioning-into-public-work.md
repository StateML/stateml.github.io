Hey there! It has been a while since we have really shared any updates on the progress of StateML, besides small teasers here and there. Furthermore, I'm not sure we have been entirely clear on goals, vision, and scope of the language. I hope to shine a little light on both of these!

- private, slow moving research
- goals of language
- grammar is stable
- large refactor to the compiler
  - portable/wasm compiler
  - data-oriented/protocol-oriented
  - more composable and pluggable
  - smaller
  - graph of statechart is serializable and queryable
- more portable LSP/performant
- reworking SCMXL's engine implementation
  - priority queue
  - transition caching/pre-compilation
  - simulation
  - debugging
- spec, test suite, and initial documentation
