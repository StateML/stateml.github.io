Hey there! It's been a while since we have shared any updates on the progress of StateML, besides a few teasers here and there. Furthermore, I'm not sure we have been entirely explicit on our goals, vision, and scope of the language. I hope to shine a little light on both of these in this post!

- private, slow moving research
- goals of language
- grammar is stable
- large refactor to the compiler
  - portable/wasm compiler
  - data-oriented/protocol-oriented
  - more composable and pluggable
  - smaller
  - graph of statechart is serializable and queryable
- more portable LSP/performant
- reworking SCMXL's engine implementation
  - priority queue
  - transition caching/pre-compilation
  - simulation
  - debugging
- spec, test suite, and initial documentation
