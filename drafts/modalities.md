> What's interesting about this is the idea that the utility of visualization might be bounded, or might be a function of factors such as current understanding of the system and size of the chart. Rather than saying the visual (or any modality) is always optimal, which is likely not the case (it may always be the preferred modality, but it may not be as useful in some situations as in others)

> The visualization (topology + geometry) is a modality for understanding the “state space”

- collapsibility is a modality for finding the level of detail important to you
- The simulation (active states + possible transitions) is a modality for understanding the present and getting a glimpse into the future
  The event log (past events, actions executed, ect.) is a modality for what happened in the past.
- The event sequence diagram is a modality for the voicemails of who the statechart was communicating with
