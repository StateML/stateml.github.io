Hi! 👋🏼

Welcome to "The Initial State" digital garden for StateML! If you weren't already aware, StateML is language for authoring state machines. We hope to enable the next-generation of state machine and statechart tooling, visualizers, and interpreters. It's about time that we start documenting our explorations, design decisions, and musings.

We decided to forgo a more traditional blog in favor of [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) or [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes). This description by Maggie Appleton is quite fitting:

> A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organized by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.

The goal is to keep notes small, composable, and densely connected so that we can easily share and evolve ideas and explanations over time. There is so much to discuss and we can't wait to start writing about it! 😄
